# Userstyles 

### What are user styles?

User styles empower your browsing experience by letting you customize web sites. Take out irrelevant content, change colors, or
completely redesign the entire site. You can even use user styles as themes on the interface of Firefox, Thunderbird, and SeaMonkey
themselves.

The most popular one is Stylish. It's awaliable for
[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/?src=external-userstyleshome),
